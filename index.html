									<h2><a href="#">About me<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Hi, my name is Yu Ying, an <b>aspiring data analyst/scientist</b> pursuing a bachelor's degree in Engineering Systems & Design with dual specialization in <b>Business Analytics and Supply Chain logistics</b> at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).</p>
									<p> Since young, I have always <b>enjoyed solving puzzles/riddles</b>. To me, huge datasets are like big puzzle pieces that I want to solve. I find it very <b>rewarding</b> and <b>meaningful</b> to explore different techniques to extract relevant information from huge datasets to perform analysis, and thereafter <b>potentially improve lives across a wide variety of sectors</b>.  </p>

									<h1>my projects</h1>
									<p>In my course of study, I have aquired hands-on experience in <b>data analytics, statistical machine learning, simulation & modelling, business process automation and big data analytics pipeline</b>. I am experienced in <b>R programming (Tidyverse, CARET, Keras, RShiny), SQL, Python (Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn), Javascript, Qlikview, Tableu, Power BI, QGIS, Simio and JaamSim</b>. Besides being equipped with the necessary technical skills, i am also a <b>self-motivated individual, a team player and a problem solver</b>. </p>

										<h2><a>Smart Inventory Management & Optimization (SIMO)<br />

									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/simo.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, my team and I are currently working with <b>Singapore Airlines Engineering Company (SIAEC)</b> on a <b>smart inventory management and optimization project</b>. Despite efforts by SIAEC in deploying inventory management practices, the company still <b>overprovisions</b> spare parts, <b>incurring unnecessary capital</b>. The underlying causes of this overprovisioning include <b>inefficient inventory management practices, forecasting techniques</b> and <b>inflexible interface</b> for managing inventory. Our project thus aims to create a <b>web-based application</b> with <b>dynamic features such as having variable inputs, scenario-based optimization and data visualization</b> to help manage and optimize spare parts in hopes of a more <b>user-friendly</b> and <b>cost-saving alternative</b> for the company to fit into their current workflow</p>

									<p>For this mini project, I was <b>given a problem scenario</b> and I had to <b>write an algorithm</b> to solve the problem and to <b> document my methods used in presentation slides within 2 days</b>. The scenario given to me was to create a tool to help a gardener to quickly <b>retrieve records of the 10 most similar iris flowers</b> in his garden for any input iris flower. The methods that I have adopted are mainly to: <b>check the quality of data, conduct data visualization (before analysis), Use of similarity measures (eg.euclidean distance)</b> and lastly create <b>visualizations for the output result</b>s. </p>

									<p>For this project, we were tasked to <b>plan a class session to teach our peers on any machine learning algorithm of our choice</b>. Together with my teammate, we have chosen <b>XGboost</b> to be the machine learning elgorithm that we will be teaching the class. Besides <b>backtracking the math concepts behind XGBoost</b>, we have also <b>implemented the XGBoost algorithm</b> on the <b>MNIST database</b>. After fine-tuning our algorithm, we have managed to attain a <b> high prediction accurcy</b> of <b>97.81%</b><br>Through this coaching project, I have also learned alot of different machine learning algorithms from other teams. Some of which inlcudes: <b>Reinforement learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Topic Modelling, etc.</b> </b></br></p>

									<p>For this project, my team and I have conducted a <b>research study on how personality drives social media usage & its subsequent effects on loneliness</b>. From our research from literature reviews, we have conducted concept explication and formulated our hypotheses. In a short period of 3 months, from <b>building a survey questionnaire, to data collection, to data cleaning, to data analysis (mediating analysis)</b>, we have <b>sucessfully gained some insights and answers</b> to our hypotheses that we have formulated. </p>

									<p>For this project, my team and I have performed <b>sentiment analysis on tweets</b> relating to weather using <b>machine learning in R</b>. I have performed <b>data cleaning and data pre-processing using R (Tidyverse & textclean library)</b>. I have also collaborated with my teammates on the development and implementation of machine learning systems in R. Some of the algorithms that we have tried include: <b>Classification Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Classification</b>. We have successfully attained a <b>high prediction accuracy</b> of <b>87.5%</b> with the implementation of our final (random forest) algorithm    </p>
